All fundamental dataType are immutable in python
    int, float, bool, str, complex

List is not immutable

x = 10
y = 10

x is y ==> True

x = 257
y = 257

x is y ==> False

    Reusing the same object is available only upto 0 to 256

x = 10.0
y = 10.0

x is y ==> False, For floating point datatype reusing is not available

x = 10+20j
y = 10+20j

x is y ==> False, For complex object, reusing is not available
