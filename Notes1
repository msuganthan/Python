Why Python:
===========

1. Simple and easy to learn
2. Freeware and Open source
3. Highlevel programming language
4. Platform independent
5. Portable
6. Dynamically Typed
7. Both Procedure oriented and Object oriented
8. Interpreted
9. Extensible
10. Embedded
11. Extensive Library 


Limitations:
============
1. Performance
2. Not suitable for mobile application

Myth:
=====
Python is not suitable for large scale application

Flavors of Python:
==================
1. CPython
2. Jython
3. IronPython
4. Pypy(performance is too good) ==> inside PVM, JIT compiler is there.
5. RubyPython
6. AnacondaPython ==> To handle huge data, we can use this Python
7. Stackless(Python for concurrency)

Rules to define identifiers in Python:
======================================

1. alphabet symbols(both upper case and lower case)
   digits(0 to 9)
   underscore(_)
2. identifier should not start with digit
3. identifiers are case-sensitive
4. keywords are not allowed as identifiers
5. There is not limit for max length limit for identifiers
6. _ => private
7. __ => strongly private
8. __main__ ==> language specific identific
